Welcome to numpy-ml
===================
`numpy-ml`_ is a growing collection of machine learning models, algorithms, and
tools written exclusively in `NumPy`_ and the Python `standard library`_.

The purpose of the project is to provide reference implementations of common
machine learning components for rapid prototyping and experimentation. With
that in mind, don't just read the docs -- read the source!

.. _NumPy: https://numpy.org/
.. _standard library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/

.. topic:: This documentation is under development!

    We're working to expand our coverage. During this time there are likely to
    be typos, bugs, and poorly-worded sections. If you encounter any of the
    above, please file an `issue`_ or submit a `pull request`_!
